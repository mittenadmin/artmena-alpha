class="c5"><span class="c1">From Cairo to Casablanca, Beirut to Baghdad, modern artists from the MENA region have played a vital&mdash;though often overlooked&mdash;role in the modern art scenes of their countries. Working through decades marked by colonialism, independence movements, wars, and sweeping social change, these artists developed bold new artistic languages. Their work doesn&rsquo;t just reflect the political and cultural shifts of the time in the region&mdash;it also challenged, critiqued, and redefined them. Today, a growing number of curators, collectors, and institutions are finally recognizing the depth and innovation of the MENA region&rsquo;s modern art scene. In this article, we spotlight the pioneering figures whose work has left an indelible mark on both regional and international art history.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c15">Mahmoud </span><span class="c3">Sa&iuml;d (1897-1964)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c13"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 424.50px; height: 490.01px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 424.50px; height: 490.01px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9 c6">Image via @</span><span class="c4 c9 c6"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/p/C1ws3CkoOLT/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082429153&amp;usg=AOvVaw0l1J3LOLdCd50pyfz4rVlz">ashkanistan87</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13 c9"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.mahmoud-said.com/aboutMS.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082429393&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Kgsf39ySdBkuEiJqTb58O">Mahmoud </a></span><span class="c4 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.mahmoud-said.com/aboutMS.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082429479&amp;usg=AOvVaw13AkOdE97O2-She8GhXZT7">Sa&iuml;d</a></span><span class="c9">&nbsp;is considered to be the founder of modern Egyptian painting and is one of the most successful Arab artists at auction, with his painting &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c9"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5362152&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082429882&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zOVp14-3NEhHfFFcJB5Lt">The Whirling Dervishes</a></span><span class="c9">&rdquo; selling for $2.5 million at Christie&rsquo;s in Dubai in 2010.

It is also noted that he started painting not long after Egypt&rsquo;s independence from Britain in 1922, a time in which nationalism was rising in the country.

Having had a multidisciplinary career, she is considered to have held the Arab world&rsquo;s first abstract painting exhibition at the Arab Cultural Gallery in Beirut in 1947. Following this groundbreaking exhibition, she decided to give herself more artistic exposure, moving to Paris in 1948 to study at the prestigious &Eacute;cole Nationale des Beaux-Arts. By 1950, she transitioned to sculpture, which she is primarily known for today. Her sculptural style consists of modular, interlocking forms which are inspired by Islamic geometry and architecture, often exploring repetition and rhythm to reflect the principles of Arab design and poetry. Her sculptures incorporate both the concept of infinite reproducibility and precise geometry, symbolising unity and multiplicity.

He is known for his elongated depictions of the human form and use of bright colours, and for tackling themes of exile, resilience and identity. His work often features groups of long, faceless, figures as a visual expression of both displacement and hope; these figures became more abstract over time. Guiragossian was born in Jerusalem to parents who had survived the 1915 Armenian Genocide, moving to Jaffa in the early 1940s where he studied painting at Studio Yarko. In 1948 his family relocated to Beirut, settling in the Armenian area of Bourj Hammoud where he worked as an illustrator and taught art in Armenian schools. Eventually he began exhibiting his works in Beirut and later across the globe. He won a number of scholarships to study in Florence and Paris. In fact, he was the first ever artist to have a solo exhibition at Paris&rsquo; Institut du Monde Arabe. His work is in the collection of the British Museum, Centre Pomidou and Mathaf Modern among others. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7">Monir FarmanFarmaian (1922-2019)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 435.50px; height: 567.41px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 435.50px; height: 567.41px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6">Image via @</span><span class="c4 c6"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/p/BwhchyZFlJP/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082453526&amp;usg=AOvVaw2L9NdgARpH5HDW6IZYN3Uh">duroolowu</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Iranian artist </span><span class="c4"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.monirff.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082453885&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DlWOc0m75MH_ldUEAtBZX">Monir FarmanFarmaian</a></span><span>&nbsp;is famous for her work with mirrors.

FarmanFarmaian fused Islamic geometry and Western minimalism, exploring themes of repetition and spirituality. Born in Qazvin, Iran, she studied at the University of Tehran before moving to New York during the Second World War, where she studied at both Cornell University and Parsons School of Design. During this time in the US she had met with Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol, but decided to move back to Iran in 1957 where she was inspired by her cultural heritage. She returned to New York in 1979 to visit family. During this time the Islamic Revolution began in Iran and she found herself exiled for over twenty years, though she struggled to create mirror pieces outside of her homeland due to limited resources. She returned to Iran in 1992 and began creating mosaic works again in 2004 with the help of others who she employed to assist her.

His practice spanned performance, installation and drawing, using art to reflect on the rapidly modernising UAE. Born in Iran, Sharif grew up in the UAE, beginning to make art in the 1970s as a political cartoonist during a time when the UAE was experiencing intense industrialisation and consumerism. By 1979 he sought to expand his artistic education, moving to London to study at the Byam Shaw School of Art (now part of the prestigious Central Saint Martins). His studies in the UK had a big impact on his process and brought his attention to conceptual art. Returning to the UAE in 1984, Sharif began to create works with everyday materials, using scrap metal, fabric and rope to create intricate and repetitive structures in a method that he termed &ldquo;weaving&rdquo;. The works were a comment on consumer culture and mass production. As well as making art, Sharif was instrumental in developing the UAE&rsquo;s art scene, co-founding the </span><span class="c4"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/emiratesfinearts/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082459939&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-XZKAwR0JUYHL0MHqPb_R">Emirates Fine Arts Society</a></span><span>&nbsp;in 1980 and the Al Marijah Art Atelier in 1984, which provided platforms for emerging artists.

Born in Amman, she was influenced by the ancient ruins near her family home. At the age of 17 she defied her family&rsquo;s restrictions - who did not allow women to study at university - and moved to Beirut to pursue her passion for art. In Beirut she immersed herself in the cultural scene, forming connections with influential artists and poets including Adonis and Paul Guiragossian. After holding her first exhibition at Caf&eacute; de la Presse in Beirut in 1963, she was able to fund her studies in Paris, graduating from the &Eacute;cole nationale sup&eacute;rieure des Beaux-Arts in 1973. Her sculptures make use of natural stones including Jordanian jade, limestone and marble, and are both geometric and organic at once. In addition to sculpture, she also made prints incorporating the poetry of Mahmoud Darwish and Adonis. Saudi has been exhibited internationally and one of her sculptures, &ldquo;Geometrie de l&rsquo;esprit&rdquo; (1987), stands permanently outside of the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris. In addition, her work is part of major institutional collections including the British Museum. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7">Etel Adnan (1925-2021)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 579.50px; height: 408.62px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 579.50px; height: 408.62px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6">Image via @</span><span class="c4 c6"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/p/DJahe4_K3Oi/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082469435&amp;usg=AOvVaw2HA_C6fbgeUyBNMbAZYImD">brin_et_al</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Lebanese artist </span><span class="c4"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whitecube.com/artists/etel-adnan&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759117082469776&amp;usg=AOvVaw2QoIIqDMoagtbYLZnWNVKD">Etel Adnan</a></span><span>&nbsp;was also a poet and essayist. Born in Beirut to a Greek Christian mother and a Syrian Muslim father, she had a multicultural upbringing. She spent much of her life outside the region, having studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris and both the University of California, Berkeley and Harvard University in the US. Following this period she taught at Dominican College in San Rafael. During the Algerian War of Independence, Adnan began painting to express herself beyond language. She is known for her bright, abstract landscapes, which are often inspired by Mount Tamalpais near her home in Sausalito, California. Her use of block colours and simplified forms is intended to convey both a sense of place and emotional intensity.
