    excerpt:
      "From Cairo to Casablanca, Beirut to Baghdad, modern artists from the MENA region have played a vital—though often overlooked—role in the modern art scenes of their countries.

Today, a growing number of curators, collectors, and institutions are finally recognizing the depth and innovation of the MENA region’s modern art scene. In this article, we spotlight the pioneering figures whose work has left an indelible mark on both regional and international art history.",
